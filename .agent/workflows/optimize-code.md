# Code Optimization Workflow

## Goal

Review and optimize the open file.

## Instructions

1. **Analyze Complexity**: Analyze the time complexity (Big O) of the current functions.
2. **Identify Optimizations**:
    - Identify any nested loops that can be flattened or optimized.
    - Check for redundant variable assignments.
3. **Output**: Provide a refactored version of the code that improves performance, and explain why it is faster.
